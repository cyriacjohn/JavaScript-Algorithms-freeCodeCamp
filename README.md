This repository showcases my progress and projects completed as part of the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) certification from FreeCodeCamp. Through these projects, I have strengthened my skills in JavaScript, algorithms, and fundamental data structures.

## 📜 Certification

I have successfully completed the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification on FreeCodeCamp. This certification involved rigorous training in JavaScript fundamentals, algorithms, and essential data structures.

## 🏆 Key Projects and Challenges

Here are some of the projects and challenges I completed as part of the course:

- **Palindrome Checker**: A JavaScript program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Roman Numeral Converter**: A function that converts decimal numbers to Roman numerals.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A program implementing a basic Caesar cipher for text encoding.
- **Telephone Number Validator**: A JavaScript function to validate the format of US phone numbers.
- **Cash Register**: A JavaScript program that simulates a basic cash register, managing transactions and returning change with appropriate denominations.

> **Note:** Each project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in algorithmic thinking and efficient problem-solving in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills

- **JavaScript**: Mastered key concepts like ES6 syntax, array manipulation, string operations, and object handling.
- **Algorithms**: Practiced classic algorithms such as sorting, recursion, and search.
- **Data Structures**: Worked with data structures including arrays, objects, stacks, and queues.

## 📈 Progress

All code challenges and projects can be found in this repository, organized by sections to make navigation easy.
